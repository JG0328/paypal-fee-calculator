# PayPal Fees Calculator [![Build](https://github.com/JG0328/paypal-fees-calculator/actions/workflows/build_react.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JG0328/paypal-fees-calculator/actions/workflows/build_react.yml)

I developed this small web application to calculate a fixed fee charged by PayPal, when doing transactions on their platform.

The current applied fee is **0.3 + 5.4%**.

## Run the project
